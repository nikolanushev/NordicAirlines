    <h2>Sky calls for freedom: July-August 2021 updated flight plan</h2>

    <p>
        After being away for a while, we are back to the sky. As a result of our
        meticulous work with national and international health authorities, we
        regain our loved ones, discoveries and memories to be accumulated through
        flights with healthier and safer standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        We are happy to offer you flexible travel opportunities as we know how
        difficult it is to plan in this period. Passengers can make unlimited changes
        for ticketings made between March 21, 2020 and December 31, 2021 (inclusive).
    </p>
    <p>
        The flight plan shows the maximum number of scheduled flights to be operated
        in a week until August 31. Please note that changes in the flight plan may occur
        due to operational services, As our flight plan is updated, we will share it with
        you on this page for your new trips.
